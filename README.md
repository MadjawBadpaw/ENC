# 🔒 Secure File Encryption App  

A Python-based GUI application for secure file encryption and decryption using **AES encryption**, **keyring-based password storage**, and a modern **TTKBootstrap** interface.  

This project allows users to encrypt and decrypt files securely, validate strong passwords, and maintain a history of operations, all wrapped in an easy-to-use graphical interface.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **AES Encryption (CBC Mode):** Secure file encryption using SHA-256 derived keys.  
✅ **Password Management:** Uses the `keyring` library to securely store and verify passwords for encrypted files.  
✅ **Password Strength Validation:** Enforces strong password rules (uppercase, symbol, minimum length).  
✅ **File History Tracking:** Maintains a clickable history of encrypted/decrypted files.  
✅ **Modern GUI:** Built with `TTKBootstrap` for a sleek dark theme.  
✅ **Auto File Removal:** Automatically deletes original files after encryption/decryption to prevent leaks.  
✅ **Cross-Platform Support:** Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
